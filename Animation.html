        <h3 class="my-header">Typical Work Project For An Animator</h3>
        <h4 class="my-header">2D-Animators</h4>
        <p>A 2D animator designs graphic images to create the illusion of movement. They draw images, both on paper and using computer software, and animate scenes to tell a story. These professionals may create a variety of animations, such as logos, action graphics or advertisements. They can work in various industries, such as technology, entertainment or architecture. Some 2D animators work as freelancers, while others may find employment with film studios, marketing agencies or software companies. </p>

        <h4 class="my-header">3D-Animators</h4>
        <p>A 3D animator uses technology to create illustrations for a particular movie, TV show or video. They follow a script and use their own creativity to draw cartoons by hand and with 3D drawing technology. They may also use motion capture devices to create movements and ultimately combine layers of illustration to create the final product.</p>
        <p>A 3D animator differs from a 2D animator. 2D animators draw animations that appear in a two-dimensional form on the screen, whereas 3D animators create multi-layered illustrations that appear to jump out of the screen, causing a more dynamic experience for the viewer.</p>

        <h3 class="my-header">Requirements To Be An Animator</h3>
        <h4 class="my-header">2D-Animator</h4>
        <p>Most 2D Animators enter the field with a college degree, with the most common majors being computer animation, media arts, illustration, or digital arts. While most 2D Animators will have a college degree in animation or another related field, like visual arts, it isn’t a strict requirement to get your motion graphics training through a four-year degree program. Many successful 2D Animators got their start without a college degree, and you shouldn’t be turned off from pursuing a career in animation if you didn’t major in it. Whether you have a degree in an unrelated field or no degree, there are still viable paths you can take to build your career in 2D animation.</p>
        <p>Students without college degrees will need a significant amount of supplemental training to demonstrate that they have comparable skills to prospective candidates who did graduate from a college computer animation program. This training is most commonly acquired in a career-focused skills development program, such as the career-certificate programs offered through Noble Desktop. These accelerated programs will teach students how to work as 2D Animators and set them up for success on the job market with targeted professionalization seminars. Students without degrees will still lag in terms of things like networking opportunities, and they will need to do more work to build their portfolios and job materials. Still, they will be well-positioned to enter the job market as competitive candidates for 2D Animation jobs.</p>

        <h4 class="my-header">3D-Animator</h4>
        <p>Whether you are taking classes in animation design or you’re learning on your own, practice the skill. Practice, practice, practice. Lots of programs for 3D animation are out there, like 3D Max, Maya, Blender, and Unity, and it’s up to you to learn and practice them. The great thing is, some of these programs are free. You can also watch YouTube for great tutorials and learning skills. The more precise and skilled your animation is, the better jobs you’ll get. Don’t expect to be perfect right away, like any skill it takes practice.</p>
        <p>As you are learning the art of 3D animation, dabble around in different aspects of it. Not only can you find your niche in the type of animation you like, but also in the components you like. Whereas having a niche is important, the more versatile you are is helpful, too. You can also have a step of 3D animation that’s your favorite, but you should have the skillset to create from start to finish, too.</p>
        <p>Some skills are really easy to learn on your own, especially if you have drive and discipline. On the other hand, some people recommend that with 3D animation, a degree or certification will help as you search to get started in your career. Classes do provide the expertise of professionals and experts in the field, and you can learn great things by being in the classroom, virtual or in person. With plenty of online classes around, don’t fret if you don’t feel like enrolling in art school. Or if you have the initiative, learn it on your own. Your skills will be the strongest asset, no matter how you attained them.</p>
